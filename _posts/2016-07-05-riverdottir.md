## Description

*Riverdottir* is a digital performance piece based on the myth of [Daphne and
Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_and_Daphne). At its core is a
single unchanging text, written in conversation with a section of Anja Utler's
[*engulf--enkindle*](http://www.burningdeck.com/catalog/utler.htm) on the same
theme. In order to access the text, however, the audience depends upon the
performer, who reveals the barely-legible words in flickering bursts. By
pressing keys on a standard keyboard, the performer temporarily illuminates
sections of the text beneath simulated waves, simultaneously playing an audible
melody of his or her choosing.

As the performance continues, the audience becomes slowly aware of the sinister
language hiding beneath the pacific audio and appealing visual surface of the
piece. Gradually, the sexual violence and (in Utler's brilliant rendering)
horrifying transformation of the myth become apparent. This realization depends
equally on how the performer chooses to present the piece and what elements of
flickering language each audience member latches onto.

In this slow revelation, *Riverdottir* highlights the complexity of
aestheticized violence and misogyny. Viewers may find themselves attracted by
its conventionally lovely surface, but whether they recoil from its underlying
terror depends on how they (and the performer) direct their attention. In this
way, the piece offers nuance in the conversation around aestheticized violence
without mitigating its horror in the underlying myth.

### Footnotes

[^1]: Due to some sort of conversion issue on upload to YouTube, the
    video/audio quality is not ideal for this documentation, so I encourage you to
    check out the "live" runnable jar version if possible.
