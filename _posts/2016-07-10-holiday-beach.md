# Holiday Beach

## Summary
 **Medium**: Print book

 **Status**: Complete (2015)

## Description

*Holiday Beach* is a novella-in-verse about a lifeguard with an unreasonably
good record for rescues. Much like the form itself, this novella-in-verse is
all about breaking free of old categories and expected social roles, only to
find them clinging in unexpected places. Four characters cross paths and slowly
come together on the titular beach over the course of a single day.

There is Ted Moony, an office drone trying simultaneously to live up to and
break out of received notions of masculinity and fulfillment. There is Word, a
woman who has forgotten her own name fighting against the labels that others
apply to her.  There is Father Joseph, a priest who cannot give up his work
despite every attempt to abandon it. And watching over it all is Emily Baker,
the lifeguard thrust into the role of hero through a literally unbelievable
series of rescues.

*Holiday Beach* was completed during my MFA at Brown University. It was
inspired in part by a (remarkable) class on the novella as distinct literary
form taught by [Brian Evenson](http://www.brianevenson.com/).
