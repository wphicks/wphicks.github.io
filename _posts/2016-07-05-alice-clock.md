## Description

*The Alice Clock* is a playful demonstration of how even simple natural
language processing can be used to highlight interesting structure in literary
works. The piece is based on a circular poem: a set of twelve words arranged in
a circle that can be read in a grammatically sensible way from any starting
point. These words all appear at least a handful of times in Lewis Carroll's
*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking-Glass*.

As the piece evolves, each word in the circular text is replaced by a word that
functions in a similar way (that is, appears in a similar context) in Carroll's
work, without disrupting the circular grammar. Thus, the word "white" might be
replaced by "red," since "the white queen" and "the red queen" are both phrases
that regularly appear in Carroll's work. Other, more surprising replacements
include "slips" for "rules" and "sorrow" for "sand."

As these replacements continue, the text wanders farther and farther from its
original sense but retains its circular structure. Occasionally, a word will
return to its original value after completing a cycle of substitutions. For
instance, "red" might go to "large," then "great," then "little," then
"passionate," and back to "red." Whenever this happens, an "Alice Minute" has
passed, and the clock chimes accordingly. If the entire circular text returns
to its original form, an "Alice Hour" has passed.

Even this rather silly, whimsical setup reveals interesting structure in
Carroll's use of language (as well as the constraint imposed by the original
circular poem). While Alice Minutes happen about once every cycle of twelve
substitutions, Alice Hours are vanishingly uncommon (in fact, one is unlikely
to occur in the lifetime of our solar system). For other texts, such cycles are
either much more or much less common, and "Minutes" may be more or less
clustered.

By drawing attention to this linguistic structure (rather than say narrative arc or
character development), *The Alice Clock* highlights aspects of Carroll's text
that undoubtedly affect reader experience but which rarely rise to the level of
conscious experience. In this way, it encourages a more nuanced appreciation of
certain aspects of literary craft.
