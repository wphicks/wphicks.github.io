## Summary
 **Medium**: Print book

 **Status**: Complete (2015)

 **Presentation/Publication history**: Published by [Synecdoche Press](

## Description

*Stargazer's Kitchen* is my first published collection of poetry and
features the visual art of sculptor Maggie Hazen. From the [press
description](http://synecdochebooks.com/maggie-hazen-will-hicks/) of the
book:

> Featuring the poetry of William Hicks and the sculpture of Maggie Hazen,
> *Stargazer’s Kitchen* offers a delicately intertwined world of language and
> visual art. Poignant, funny, and at times tragic, the poems and art of
> *Stargazer’s Kitchen* come together in a powerful call and response,
> creating a whole that is both beautiful and thought-provoking. Not just an
> art book grafted onto a book of poetry, this first title from Synecdoche
> Press offers a meaningful and moving conversation between artist and
> poet.  Poetry becomes visual and sculpture becomes literary as you read
> through *Stargazer’s Kitchen*.
