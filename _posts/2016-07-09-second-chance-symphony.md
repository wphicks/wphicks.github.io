# Second Chance Symphony

## Summary
 **Medium**: Custom C++ software using the [SFML library](
     http://www.sfml-dev.org/)

 **Status**: In development

## Description

*Second Chance Symphony* (SCS) is a game about space travel with a control
scheme based on principles of music theory. Players take on the role of a
ship's captain transporting refugees along a dangerous route. By playing
notes at particular intervals, players navigate this treacherous musical
landscape. Gradually, more complex ideas from music theory are introduced,
increasing difficulty but also unlocking new abilities for the player's
ship.

Narratively, the game focuses on the importance of learning from mistakes
without dwelling on them. Players must return to the site of former
failures, and though they may not correct those failures, they can find ways
to take advantage of them (just as improvisational music depends on
incorporating missteps). 

## Development Status

For awhile, I've been looking for excuses to

1. Play with the SFML library
2. Brush up on the great new features of C++14
3. Work with music theory in a digital narrative

*SCS* is an excuse to do all three. Since it's not quite as "serious" as some
of my other ongoing digital projects, it will likely move forward in
irregular bursts. You can keep an eye on the [Github repository](
https://github.com/wphicks/second-chance-symphony) for *SCS*, which I'll try
to push to regularly once I have a minimal playable version.
