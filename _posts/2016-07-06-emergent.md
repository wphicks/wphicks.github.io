## Description

One of the most startling phenomena in the study of statistical mechanics is
that of self-assembly. From basic crystal formation to the spontaneous
assembly of viral capsids, self-assembly consistently violates
common-sense understanding of the way the world *ought* to work. Looking at
the [iflaviridae capsid](
http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=ent_pubs),
one might think it about as likely to spontaneously build itself from
constituent parts as a teacup is to jump into being from broken shards. Yet
such processes are vital to the emergence and sustenance of life.

In *emergent*, we consider the process of self-assembly in language and
meaning rather than molecules. The defining feature of self-assembly is the
development of complex organization from simple interactions, so
*emergent* works with language at the level of bigrams, considering only
which word should proceed or follow any given word. While such
considerations are frequently used in linear Markov-generated texts,
*emergent* uses these simple interactions to explore patterns of text on a 2D
grid of language. With the additional constraint provided by vertical
patterns within a text, the algorithm behind *emergent* could spontaneously
reproduce large swathes of that text.

Rather than reproducing existing texts, however, *emergent* biases its
patterns of interaction with other data. Specifically, the bigrams of
*emergent* are weighted using simple EEG data collected while various
readers examined texts related to emergent structures and behaviors. These
data are then used to build up entirely new, shifting, and unstable
patterns which form the readable surface of the work.

Issues of both authorship and readership are strongly at stake in this
piece. If the ostensible author specifies only the simple interactions
which lead to the assembly of a readable surface, then to what extent can he
be credited as the creator of that surface? Furthermore,
though readers assemble meaning through their own associative interaction
with the text, *emergent*'s surface changes too rapidly for anyone to
traverse its myriad possible readings before it has moved on to a new
linguistic patterns. Neither the author nor the reader nor even the
algorithm entirely controls what facets of the text are "read" in the most
literal sense of the word. *emergent* is not a simple act of transmission
from well-defined author to well-defined reader mediated by digital
algorithm.  Rather, it is an emergent phenomenon that develops out of an
ongoing, cooperative act of creation and interpretation.
