## Description

One of the most startling phenomena in the study of statistical mechanics is
that of self-assembly. From basic crystal formation to the spontaneous
assembly of viral capsids, self-assembly consistently violates
common-sense understanding of the way the world *ought* to work. Looking at
the [iflaviridae capsid](
http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=ent_pubs),
one might think it about as likely to spontaneously build itself from
constituent parts as a teacup is to jump into being from broken shards. Yet
such processes are vital to the emergence and sustenance of life.

In *emergent*, we consider the process of self-assembly in language and
meaning rather than molecules. The defining feature of self-assembly is the
development of complex organization from simple interactions, so
*emergent* works with language at the level of bigrams, considering only
which word should proceed or follow any given word. While such
considerations are frequently used in linear Markov-generated texts,
*emergent* uses these simple interactions to explore patterns of text on a 2D
grid of language. With the additional constraint provided by vertical
patterns within a text, the algorithm behind *emergent* could spontaneously
reproduce large swathes of that text.

Rather than reproducing existing texts, however, *emergent* biases its
patterns of interaction with other data. Specifically, the bigrams of
*emergent* are weighted using simple EEG data collected while various
readers examined texts related to emergent structures and behaviors. These
data are then used to build up entirely new, shifting, and unstable
patterns which form the readable surface of the work.

Issues of both authorship and readership are strongly at stake in this
piece. The ostensible author specifies the simple interactions which
produce *emergent*'s surface as well as the base text used to produce EEG
data, but he has no control over the details of that data. The algorithm
that assembles the readable surface may determine what text is presented to the
audience, but it cannot control the path that audience takes in reading.
Finally, the meaning of the piece is assembled in the mind of the
audience, through the patterns of association they discover in its surface
text. *emergent* is not a simple act of transmission from well-defined
author to well-defined reader mediated by digital algorithm. Rather, it is an
emergent phenomenon that develops out of an ongoing, cooperative act of
creation and interpretation.
