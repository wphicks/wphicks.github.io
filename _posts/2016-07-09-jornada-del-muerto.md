# Jornada del Muerto

## Summary
 **Medium**: Print book

 **Status**: Ongoing

## Description

*Jornada del Muerto* is a novel-in-verse about a bus driver and his passenger
travelling through a desert in the American West. As they proceed, the pair are
drawn into a surreal world of history and myth baked into the sands of this
desolate place.

The novel is structured in three parts, the first of which was written as my
MFA thesis for the Brown University literary arts program. Joanna Howard (who
described this project as "Sergio Leone meets Tarkovsky meets David Lynch")
served as my thesis advisor and has been absolutely integral to its
development. You can listen to a recording of a reading from *Jornada del
Muerto* below:
